# Dataset-Generation-for-Anomaly-Detection

This project is based on the paper 'Systematic construction of anomaly detection benchmarks from real data' by Andrew F. Emmott, Shubhomoy Das, Thomas Dietterich, Alan Fern and Weng-Keen Wong. 
The paper can be found here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.01158v1.pdf

I used moslty the part to generate the dataset itself (Section 3.2) and then benchmarking 3 different Anomaly Detection methods.
1) Isolation Forest
2) Local Outlier Factor
3) AutoEncoders
